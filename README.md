# GathererComments
Adds a new comment section to the MTG Gatherer website to each card page (the current comment system is disabled)

Installation Instructions: 

1) Download GathererComments.zip
2) Unzip GathererComments.zip into it's own folder. 
3) Go to settings -> extensions, and in the top right check "developer mode"
4) Then select "Load Unpacked Extension", and select the folder you unzipped GathererComments.zip into. 

Now, just visit a Gatherer card details page, and it should hopefully work!

NOTE: The comment section disappears if the window is shrinked beyond a certain size - yes, I realize this isn't ideal, especially for those that have smaller screens. I'm working on a better fix for this.

DOUBLE NOTE: The comment system I currently use, HTML Comment Box, is also not ideal. If this project gathers any real interest, I will likely upgrade to something else.
